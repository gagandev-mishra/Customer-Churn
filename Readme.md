# Customer Churn

When the customer stops using their products or services due to any reason, then it's called customer churn, where the business has lost a valuable or prospective customer who can be profitable for the establishment, but due to any reason now the customer is not engaged with the business, and that is not what the business wants.

So, here you will see what the normal customer looks like in terms of demographics, the type of service they have enrolled in, what made the customer end their service with the business, and many more important aspects you will find once you run down through the steps.

But before that, let me brief you on the dataset on which I'm going to analyze it.

## Dataset Background

This dataset belongs to one of the fictitious telecom providers that provide telecom services to their California-based customers, which I downloaded from Github. Originally, it belonged to IBM, but no name was mentioned for the telecom provider, so I put Fictel as the provider name for reference in my analysis.

After downloading the dataset, I converted the file into a CSV and added it to the PostgreSQL database so that I could analyze it with the SQL query.

The table in which I'm going to work as follows:

    Telco_customer_churn_services
    Telco_customer_churn_status
    Telco_customer_churn_population
    Telco_customer_churn_location
    Telco_customer_churn_demographics
