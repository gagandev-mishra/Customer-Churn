        "Churned customers typically opt for month-to-month contracts, and their reasons for churn often align with competitors offering better devices, deals, and occasionally inadequate support during their tenure as customers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Intrestingly, data also speaks the same: married individuals are less likely to switch networks as compared to non-married people, so the company should make sure the married customers are happy with the service.\n",
        "As you will find, the churn rate is 35.79%, compared to 64.21% in non-married individuals.\n",

        "2. Also train the staff to be more polite towards customers, and incentivize the employee with a good rating so they will be more happy to assist customers.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. On average, the churn user age is between 45-50, and with unmarried people churning, any medium, if we can monitor their satisfaction level, can make the churn rate even lower.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Even the marketing team can market their service to the 40–50 age group of people.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. From the other big cities in California, San Diego, customers are getting more churned. If we have something special for this region, then we can have happy customers.\n",
